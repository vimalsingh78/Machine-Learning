## 🚀 Installation
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/vimalsingh78/Machine-Learning.git
cd Machine-Learning
```

2. Create a virtual environment (recommended):
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 💻 Usage
Each module in the repository can be used independently. Here's a basic example:

```python
from src.models import NeuralNetwork
from src.preprocessing import DataPreprocessor

# Load and preprocess data
preprocessor = DataPreprocessor()
X_train, X_test = preprocessor.process(data)

# Train model
model = NeuralNetwork()
model.train(X_train, y_train)
```

For more detailed examples, check the `examples/` directory.
